\section{WBS (FY18 onwards) --- 1.02C: Data Management Construction}
\label{sec:wbslist}

This WBS element provides the complete LSST Data Management System (DMS). The
DMS has these main responsibilities in the LSST system:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Process the incoming stream of images generated by the Camera
  Subsystem during observing to generate and archive the LSST nightly data
  products.}

  \item{Provide real-time information on data quality to the Observatory
  Control System (OCS) during observing.}

  \item{Process the entire survey data each year to produce deep catalogs of
  objects and precise measurements of those objects.}

  \item{Capture and process calibration images from the Camera Subsystem.
  Incorporate pipeline improvements and correct errors.}

  \item{Provide a VO-compliant interface that makes publicly available all
  generated data products.}

\end{itemize}
