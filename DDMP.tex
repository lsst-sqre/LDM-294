\section{DM Discussion and Decision Making Process}
\label{sect:ddmp}

DM has adopted a multi-layered approach to making decisions.
In general, decisions are made at the lowest level possible within the team --- at the level of the individual developer where practical.
When this is not possible, decision making is escalated through the
hierarchy described below.

DM team members are empowered to make decisions as outlined in \href{https://developer.lsst.io/team/empowerment.html}{the Developer Guide : Empowerment}

The \gls{RFC} process is detailed in \href{https://developer.lsst.io/communications/rfc.html}{The developer guide : RFC }.
